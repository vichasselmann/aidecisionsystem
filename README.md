# AI Decision System

AI Decision System for Unity written in C# using Utility Theory. This project is a study case for building a better Artificial Intelligence. 
This approach covers some techniques I learnt during the development of [Conflict 0 : Revolution](http://www.vhasselmann.me/games/revolution.html).

# Architecture/Design

I wrote a [post](http://www.vhasselmann.me/programming/2018/03/06/ai-programming-series.html) explaining my approach for this solution.

# Acknowledgements

I'll be working on a full game that uses this techniques to show case the solution.
